about=Module for analysing streets traveled from every node in networked streets. It also provides analyses of the network of streets to provide data on node centrality and  efficiency measures. The modul has been used to assess modern and ancient street networks applying space syntax methods. There are two dependencies needed, which are networkx (2.2) and pysal (1.14). Users are encouraged to look at https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html and https://pysal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/installation.html for installation of these two libraries.
